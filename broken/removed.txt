A LOT of code parts was removed from public version, not because they are 'secret' but becuase they are
unusable/unfinished/broken/dirty written, for example:

1) MapReduce interface.
   This software were mostly used for parsing very large tcpdumps(several terabytes) in MapReduce environment.
   Unusable now becuase Yandex MapReduce is proprietary software, not available outside.
   I always wanted to port it to Hadoop. But I have neither Hadoop installation nor tcpdump large enough.
   Ask me if you large company and need this feature.
   
2) HTTPS decryption.
   Most traffic is encrypted now but we need to diagnose it too.
   It is possible to implement with help of client or server we need one of them to write master secret for session to file.
   To get it from Chrome you need to set environment variable SSLKEYLOGFILE=/path/to/file.txt, to get it from server you 
   need to patch it.
   This code was in stage "works on my machine"(tm), was slow, and awfully written. I.e. was never finished.
   Still hope to finish it sometime, write me if you need it.
   
3) Some code chunks, for example R files to make repors and graphs. It never was a product I just used them myself.
   also they were highly yandex specific, i.e. port numbers were used to determine service, etc.

But nevertheless Yandex released this code with public license too, I removed it not becuase of license limitation, 
but just to remove unusable junk from the project. This code could be restored if somebody needs them and could 
provide me with testing environment and data.
