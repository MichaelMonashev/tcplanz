To support https parsing or SPDY/HTTP2 parsing we mush be able to handle stack of protocols.
I.e. in current architecture we always have:
 HTTP over TCP 
In real world it could be:
 HTTP over SPDY over SSL/TLS over TCP/UDP
I.e. we need to be able to handle abstract records over abstract records.
I started refactoring to implement this functionality, it was never finished
